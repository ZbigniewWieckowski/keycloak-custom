secret questions
- message_en stores the questions?
- create a custom JPA object ?
- create a configuration in required action or authenticator -- they both need this
- cookie is a machine authenticator itself

if we want to add a secret question to the group, easy
if we want to remove a secret question, remove it from all users and ensure that each user has a minumim number of questions
should we manage secret questions in the database or in the freemarker template?
database would be best, id to question
answer to id
credential model not sufficient to store multiple of same type

configurable
store X number of questions and present Y number at challenge where Y <= X
each failure will revoke the previous list and choose randomly from the remainder
or
repeat same question Z number of times before moving to next one

brute force detector
-number of concurrent lockouts within a given period

separating machine cookie from secret questions allows it to be reused and configured 
- use for OTP as well, or require both OTP and Secret Question
- use service for geolocation
- requires a the password form to set the cookie, separate set of actions from the authenticator class
- password form could have a check box to configure if cookie would be set or not 

terms and conditions
- by realm or by client or by role
- should we really manage this? or should it be application specific
- to keep registration and login flows consistent yes
